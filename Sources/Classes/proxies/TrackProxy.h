/** 
 The TrackProxy handles sending and maintaining batched tracking requests.
 In order to simplify the tracking methods themselves we must keep an up to date
 reference to the current models being viewed by the user. This means setting catalogModel, pageModels,
 elementModel, productModel and shareSite whenever the user views or accesses any screens or presentations
 related to those models.
 
 ## Discussion
 In the future it may be a good idea to simplify the specific tracking calls to take
 those models as parameters, then hold references to them internally instead of setting them explicitly before
 their associated tracking calls. For example:
 
     - (void)trackViewCatalog;
     - (void)trackViewPage;
     - (void)trackTapElement;
     - (void)trackViewProduct;
 
 could be updated to:
 
     - (void)trackViewCatalog:(CatalogModel*)catalog;
     - (void)trackViewPages:(NSArray<<PageModel*>*)pages;
     - (void)trackTapElement:(ElementModel*)element;
     - (void)trackViewProduct:(ProductModel*)product;
 
 and then references to the specific models can be updated in the implementation of those methods, and lastly those models'
 property declarations can be privatized. This would require an update of all client apps.
